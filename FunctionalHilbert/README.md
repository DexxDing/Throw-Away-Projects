# Functional Hilbert
This is basic haskell realization of hilbert curve, using Diagrams package.
Has coloured and non coloured drawing function.

### This is basically whole code for calculating hilbert curve:

```
hilbert :: Int -> Trail V2 Double
hilbert 0 = mempty
hilbert n = hilbert (n-1)  # rotateBy (1/4) # reflectY <> vrule 1
         <> hilbert (n-1) <> hrule 1
         <> hilbert (n-1) <> vrule (-1)
         <> hilbert (n-1)  # rotateBy (1/4) # reflectX
```
